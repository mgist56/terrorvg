# Planning

### Basic Outline
Our goal is to create a video game based on the AMC show, *The Terror*. We will complete a game that allows players to experience, at the very least, the first episode. The gameplay, dialouge, and game design will be simple and based on other 2D RPG games. As neither of us have any experience with game development, we want to keep the requirements for our project reasonable, but still ambitious.

### Anticipated Scheduling and Issues
It's hard to predict how long the process will take. As mentioned previously, we are not game designers  and still need to learn many of the fundamentals of making even a simple game. 

* Week 1: We will work on learning how to make a simple colored box move in a blank space, likely controlled by the arrow keys.
