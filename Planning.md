# Planning

### Basic Outline
Our goal is to create a video game based on the AMC show, *The Terror*. We will complete a game that allows players to experience, at the very least, the first episode. The gameplay, dialouge, and game design will be simple and based on other 2D RPG games. As neither of us have any experience with game development, we want to keep the requirements for our project reasonable, but still ambitious.

### Anticipated Schedule
It's hard to predict how long the process will take. As mentioned previously, we are not game designers  and still need to learn many of the fundamentals of making even a simple game. 

* Weeks 1-4: We will learn how simple 2D game design works. We will hopefully have created a program where a player controls a simple avatar. There will be places with collision detection so that the player cannot leave the screen. Hopefully, this process will not take 4 weeks, but we are in uncharted waters here. It's hard to predict how long any of this will take.
* Weeks 5-12: We will create our *Terror* game. 
  * Weeks 5-7: We will convert our basic game into a world fitting the *Terror* theme. We will begin work on implementing objectives and progression.
  * Weeks 8-12: We will refine the game's objectives so that there is a coherent narrative. We will (hopefully) create small minigames where a player can fulfill tasks relevant to the story that would not be possible through the simple 2D walk system. Finally, we can playtest the game and make improvements, if time allows.
