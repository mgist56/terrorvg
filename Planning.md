# Planning

### Basic Outline
Our goal is to create a video game based on the AMC show, *The Terror*. We will complete a game that allows players to experience, at the very least, the first episode. The gameplay, dialouge, and game design will be simple and based on other 2D RPG games. As neither of us have any experience with game development, we want to keep the requirements for our project reasonable, but still ambitious.

### Anticipated Schedule
It's hard to predict how long the process will take. As mentioned previously, we are not game designers  and still need to learn many of the fundamentals of making even a simple game. 

* Weeks 1-4: We will learn how simple 2D game design works. We will hopefully have created a program where a player controls a simple avatar. There will be places with collision detection so that the player cannot leave the screen. Hopefully, this process will not take 4 weeks, but we are in uncharted waters here. It's hard to predict how long any of this will take.
* Weeks 5-12: We will create our *Terror* game. 
  * Weeks 5-7: We will convert our basic game into a world fitting the *Terror* theme. We will begin work on implementing objectives and progression.
  * Weeks 8-12: We will refine the game's objectives so that there is a coherent narrative. We will (hopefully) create small minigames where a player can fulfill tasks relevant to the story that would not be possible through the simple 2D walk system. Finally, we can playtest the game and make improvements, if time allows.

  Measure of Success: Make a video game that reflects at least the first episode of AMC’s The Terror that can be controlled by a raspberry pi controller.

Hardware Design
Design controller with directional buttons and interact button
	Maybe D-pad where one plus-shaped part sits on all 4 buttons
After programming/wiring complete:
Assemble all of the parts in the completed design

Hardware Programming
Wire binary directional buttons
Program binary directional buttons in python
Wire an interact button/confirm it works with buttons
Program an interact button in python

Software
Use unity to program a simple 2D RPG Terror game

Visual
Design sprites for the Terror game
Design scenes for the Terror game
Hide & Seek

Gameplay
Design basic gameplay for “Go for Broke”:
Scene title cards
Play Ross to Netsilik Camp
Scene Translator “we are gone”
Play Jopson care for Crozier
	
Scene officers’ dinner
Scene Young coughs up blood
Scene Billy Orren overboard
Play Goodsir attend to Young
Scene Young sees shaman
Scene Collins goes down
Play Collins propeller fix
Play Goodsir operate on Young
Scene officers “go for broke”
Play Hickey bury David Young
Scene Sir John oh crap moment
Design basic dialogue for “Go for Broke”

Audio
Text audio during dialogue; different pitched “pings”
Ambiance noises during gameplay and cutscenes
